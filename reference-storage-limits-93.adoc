ONTAP Cloud has storage configuration limits to provide reliable operations. For best performance, do not configure your system at the maximum values.

The following sections list limits for aggregates, volumes, LUNs, and related storage objects. Note that the maximum capacity for an ONTAP Cloud system is model specific. ONTAP Cloud configurations that support a lower raw capacity limit cannot reach some of the size and disk limits.

== Physical storage limits for ONTAP Cloud in AWS

[cols=3*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Physical storage
| Parameter
| Limit

.5+| *Aggregates and disks*
| Maximum number of aggregates | 34 for single-node configurations
18 per node in an HA configuration ^1^
| Maximum aggregate size |	96 TiB of raw capacity
| Disks per aggregate	| 1-6 ^2^
| Maximum disk size | 16 TiB
| Maximum number of data disks across all aggregates ^3^ | 34 for single-node configurations
31 per node in an HA configuration
| *RAID groups*	| Maximum per aggregate	| 1
|===

Notes:

. It is not possible to create 18 aggregates on both nodes in an HA pair because doing so would exceed the data disk limit.

. All disks in an aggregate must be the same size.

. The data disk limit is specific to disks that contain user data. The boot disk and root disk for each node are not included in this limit.

== Physical storage limits for ONTAP Cloud in Azure

[cols=3*,options="header,autowidth"]

| Physical storage
| Parameter
| Limit

.5+| *Aggregates and disks*
| Maximum number of aggregates | 63
| Maximum aggregate size |	200 TiB of raw capacity
| Disks per aggregate	| 1-12 ^1^
| Maximum disk size | 32 TiB
| Maximum number of data disks across all aggregates ^2^ a|
* DS3_v2: 15
* DS4_v2: 31
* DS5_v2: 63
* DS13_v2: 31
* DS14_v2: 63
| *RAID groups*	| Maximum per aggregate	| 1

Notes:

. All disks in an aggregate must be the same size.

. The data disk limit is specific to disks that contain user data. The boot disk and root disk for each node are not included in this limit.

== Logical storage limits

[cols="22,22,56",width=100%,options="header"]
|===
| Logical storage
| Parameter
| Limit

| *Storage virtual machines (SVMs)*	| Maximum number for ONTAP Cloud
(HA pair or single node) | One data-serving SVM and one destination SVM used for disaster recovery. You can activate the destination SVM for data access if thereâ€™s an outage on the source SVM. ^1^

The one data-serving SVM spans the entire ONTAP Cloud system (HA pair or single node).
.2+| *Files*	| Maximum size | 16 TiB
| Maximum per volume |	Volume size dependent, up to 2 billion
| *FlexClone volumes*	| Hierarchical clone depth ^2^ | 499
.3+| *FlexVol volumes*	| Maximum per node |	500
| Minimum size |	20 MB
| Maximum size |	AWS: Dependent on the size of the aggregate ^3^
Azure: 100 TiB
| *Qtrees* |	Maximum per FlexVol volume |	4,995
| *Snapshot copies* |	Maximum per FlexVol volume |	255

|===

Notes:

. Cloud Manager does not provide any setup or orchestration support for SVM disaster recovery. It also does not support storage-related tasks on an additional SVM. You must use System Manager or the CLI for SVM disaster recovery.

. Hierarchical clone depth is the maximum depth of a nested hierarchy of FlexClone volumes that can be created from a single FlexVol volume.

. Less than 100 TiB is supported because aggregates for this configuration are limited to 96 TiB of _raw_ capacity.

== iSCSI storage limits

[cols=3*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| iSCSI storage
| Parameter
| Limit

.4+| *LUNs*	| Maximum per node |	1,024
| Maximum number of LUN maps |	1,024
| Maximum size	| 16 TiB
| Maximum per volume	| 512
| *igroups*	| Maximum per node | 256
.2+| *Initiators*	| Maximum per node |	512
| Maximum per igroup	| 128
| *iSCSI sessions* |	Maximum per node | 1,024
.2+| *LIFs*	| Maximum per port |	32
| Maximum per portset	| 32
| *Portsets* |	Maximum per node |	256
