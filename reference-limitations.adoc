Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

== General limitations

The following limitations apply to ONTAP Cloud in AWS and in Azure.

=== Maximum concurrent replication operations

The maximum number of concurrent SnapMirror or SnapVault transfers for Cloud Volumes ONTAP is 100 per node, regardless of the instance type or machine type.

=== Software updates must be completed by Cloud Manager

Upgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be completed from Cloud Manager. You should not upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI. Doing so can impact system stability.

=== Encryption is not supported on boot and root disks

If you enabled an option from your cloud provider that automatically encrypts all new volumes or disks, then you must temporarily disable that option when deploying ONTAP Cloud. If you don't, then deployment of ONTAP Cloud will fail. Encryption is not supported on the boot and root disks for the ONTAP Cloud system.

=== ONTAP Cloud deployment must not be modified from your cloud providerâ€™s console

Changes to an ONTAP Cloud configuration from your cloud provider's console results in an unsupported configuration. Any changes to the ONTAP Cloud resources that Cloud Manager creates and manages can impact system stability and Cloud Manager's ability to manage the system.

=== Disks and aggregates must be managed from Cloud Manager

All disks and aggregates must be created and deleted directly from Cloud Manager. You should not perform these actions from another management tool. Doing so can impact system stability, hamper the ability to add disks in the future, and potentially generate redundant cloud provider fees.

=== SnapManager licensing limitation

SnapManager per-server licenses are supported with ONTAP Cloud. Per-storage system (SnapManager suite) licenses are not supported.

=== Unsupported ONTAP features

The following features are not supported with ONTAP Cloud:

* Aggregate-level inline deduplication
* Aggregate-level background deduplication
* Disk maintenance center
* Disk sanitization
* Fibre Channel (FC)
* Flash Pools
* FlexCache
* FlexGroup volumes
* Infinite Volumes
* Interface groups
* Intranode LIF failover
* MetroCluster
* Multi-tenancy (only one data-serving SVM is supported)
* NetApp Volume Encryption
* RAID4, RAID-DP, RAID-TEC (RAID0 is supported)
* Service Processor
* SnapLock
* SnapMirror Synchronous
* VLANs

== Known limitations for ONTAP Cloud in AWS

The following known limitations affect ONTAP Cloud in AWS.

=== False alarms reported by Amazon CloudWatch

ONTAP Cloud does not release CPUs when idle, so Amazon CloudWatch can report a high CPU warning for the EC2 instance because it sees 100% usage. You can ignore this alarm. The ONTAP statistics command displays the true usage of the CPUs.

=== ONTAP Cloud HA pairs do not support immediate storage giveback

After a node reboots, the partner must sync data before it can return the storage. The time that it takes to resync data depends on the amount of data written by clients while the node was down and the data write speed during the time of giveback.

=== Limitations with the AWS GovCloud (US) region

* Cloud Manager must be deployed in an AWS GovCloud (US) region if you want to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances in any AWS GovCloud (US) region.
* The ONTAP Cloud pay-as-you-go AMI is not supported in the AWS GovCloud (US) region.
* When deployed in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, Cloud Manager cannot discover ONTAP clusters in a NetApp Private Storage for Microsoft Azure configuration or a NetApp Private Storage for SoftLayer configuration.

=== Detaching and reattaching EBS volumes is not supported

Detaching an EBS volume from an ONTAP Cloud instance and then reattaching it to another ONTAP Cloud instance is not supported. You should use Cloud Manager to replicate data between instances.

=== Encryption limitations

* LUN move is not supported on systems that have ONTAP Cloud encryption enabled.
* ONTAP Cloud sends encryption keys to key managers even for aggregates that it failed to create.
+
You must manually delete the keys from key managers.

== Known limitations for ONTAP Cloud in Azure

The following known limitations affect ONTAP Cloud in Azure.

=== ONTAP Cloud pay-as-you-go not available for CSP partners

If you are a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner, you cannot deploy ONTAP Cloud Explore, Standard, or Premium because pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not available for CSP partners. You must purchase a license and deploy ONTAP Cloud BYOL.
